Bird Species Detection, focuses on identifying different bird species using deep learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook (Deep_Learning_Project (2).ipynb) likely contains the model training process, dataset preprocessing, and evaluation metrics. The project aims to classify bird species using image data, possibly utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other deep learning models. The README.md file currently only has the project title, but it should be expanded to include details like the objective, dataset used, model architecture, installation steps, and usage instructions. To upload this project to GitHub, you need to create a repository, add all relevant files, commit the changes, and push them using Git. Proper documentation will make the project easier to understand and use for others.
